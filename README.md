drupal-lamp
=================

A vagrant build to run a Drupal LAMP stack utilizing best practices.

Our vision is to aid the Drupal Community by removing the complexity of managing a development environment and to offer a bridge to maintain parity and best practices when going live.

Requirements
------------
There are two requirements that you need to manage before you can begin.
* You need to install virtualbox https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
* You need to install vagrant 1.4.3. http://www.vagrantup.com/download-archive/v1.4.3.html

Installation Simple:
------------
To install drupal lamp, you must have Vagrant and Virtual box already installed.

```
cd ~/
mkdir ~/vagrant
cd vagrant
git clone git@github.com:newmediadenver/drupal-lamp.git
cd drupal-lamp
mkdir assets
vagrant plugin install vagrant-berkshelf
vagrant plugin install vagrant-omnibus
```

***Note:*** On OSX Mavericks, run: ```sudo /Library/StartupItems/VirtualBox/VirtualBox restart```

```
vagrant up
```

During the install process. Edit ```/etc/hosts``` add the line:

```
192.168.50.5  example.local
```

Once the vagrant process is complete, visit http://example.local

To work on the files locally, you will need to set up a method of file sharing. This
is described in the below sections. *** Note:*** You will need to run ```vagrant
destroy -f && vagrant up```after changing the settings. This *WILL* destroy your
machine and work, so make sure it is versioned.

Installation Complex:
-------------
### Custom Drupal Site(s)
Drupal-lamp allows for you to easily work with multiple sites at once using pre-existing
git repos.

To start customizing your machine:

Edit: ```infrastructure/drupal_lamp.json```

Instructions: [Drupal](https://github.com/newmediadenver/drupal)

***NOTE:*** Make sure that you have a data-bag associated with the each unique site id.
See below for info about data-bags.

Once your done: ```vagrant provision```

### Other Cookbook Settings
To control the settings of other cookbooks.

Edit: ```infrastructure/drupal_lamp.json```

Each Cookbook that is in the run list found here: ```chef/roles/drupal_lamp.rb```
has associated hashes that can be manipulated and overrode through arrays in the
JSON. Look in the berksfile for those cookbooks, and the repos for those settings.

### To Add Cookbooks

Edit: ```Berksfile``` and place call your desired cookbook.
Instructions: [Berkshelf](http://berkshelf.com/)

Edit: ```chef/roles/drupal_lamp.rb```
Add the cookbook to the runlist at the bottom of the file.

Edit: ```infrastructure/drupal_lamp.json```
Add the array of data needed for the desired cookbook.


## Chef Configuration

#### Data Bags (Hash or Mash)
If you make a new or edit the existing site id in the drupal_lamp.json, you will
need to create a databag for that site with the same id as the site name. Steps to do so:

1. ```cp chef/data_bags/sites/example.json chef/data_bags/sites/[site_name].json```
1. Now edit the [site_name].json and change id of the site id.
1. Edit the info for your site.

## Vagrant Configuration

### Create a file share

#### Drupal-NFS (Set up a NFS share on the VM, mount it on your local machine)
This is the speediest option and is compatible with any system that can mount
NFS shares.

see [Drupal-NFS cookbook](https://github.com/arknoll/drupal-nfs)

#### Vagrant-provided nfs (Vagrant sets up a NFS share on your local machine, then mounts it on the VM.)
see [NFS in Vagrant Docs](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/synced-folders/nfs.html)

1. Get required prerequisits (see Vagrant Doc)
2. Add code/uncomment in Vagrantfile
````
# for Vagrant nfs support
config.nfs.map_uid = 0
config.nfs.map_gid = 0

...
# for Vagrant nfs support
# Ensure the second parameter (/assets) is the same as the Default['drupal']['server']['assets']
# destination in your drupal_lamp.json file
server.vm.synced_folder "assets", "/assets", :nfs => true
````
Vagrant reload

#### Vagrant synced folders (slower - Vagrant sets up a virtualbox share on your local machine, then mounts it on the VM.)
see [Synced folders in Vagrant Docs](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/synced-folders/basic_usage.html)
Add code/uncomment in Vagrantfile
````
# For Vagrant synced folders
# Ensure the second parameter (/assets) is the same as the Default['drupal']['server']['assets']
# destination in your drupal_lamp.json file
server.vm.synced_folder "assets", "/assets", :nfs => false, :owner => "www-data", :group => "www-data"
````


Known "plug-ins" for drupal-lamp
--------------------------------
## Typical plug-in usage
1. Add the cookbook to the Berksfile
2. Add the role to the chef/roles/drupal_lamp.rb
3. Modify any attributes in your drupal_lamp.json if necessary

### Drupal-NFS
Allows you to expose and configure NFS shares on the VM.
see [Drupal-NFS cookbook](https://github.com/arknoll/drupal-nfs)

### Drupal-solr
Installs Apache Solr on your virtual machine.
see [Drupal solr cookbook](http://github.com/arknoll/drupal)

### Drupal-codeception
Installs [Codeception](http://codeception.com/) testing framework on your virtual machine.
see [Drupal codeception cookbook](http://github.com/arknoll/drupal-codeception)

### Drupal-frontend
Adds CSS Preprocessing on spin up. More coolness to come.
See [Drupal Frontend](http://github.com/timodwhit/drupal-frontend)

### Create a self-signed ssl certificate
See wiki [SSL in a dev environment](https://github.com/newmediadenver/drupal-lamp/wiki/SSL-in-a-dev-environment)

## Why are you doing this? ##
There's a big, complex problem that is instantly born when someone has the thought "I need to spin up a new drupal site."  Personally, I'm tired of having to spend any time thinking about how to do that. The conversation is relevant and it is gaining momentum.
