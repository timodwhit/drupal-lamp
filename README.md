VAMPD
=====

vampd looks to become a one stop solution for local development and deployment
strategy helping to standardize processes and dev flow without constricting the
environments or needs of the developer. Our vision is to increase productivity
by providing a stable, reproducible, virtualized environments that include
meet all your drupal needs.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

The install of vampd is not the easiest thing, but if you are familiar with the
command line, should be fairly simple.

First thing is first, you will need to install [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
and install [virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). If you are on
a Mac you will also need to install X-code from the App store (for Git).

Now open your terminal of choice.

The following commands are recommended and will help us trouble shoot if future
issues arise.
```
cd ~
mkdir vagrant
cd vagrant
git clone https://github.com/vampd/vampd.git
cd vampd
vagrant plugin install vagrant-berkshelf --plugin-version '2.0.1'
vagrant plugin install vagrant-omnibus
vagrant up
```

Now, you will see a bunch of text run and automate. During this time we recommend you
edit your /etc/hosts file to add the proper site name and ip address so the site
will resolve.

To do this open a new tab in the terminal:
```
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

By default the IP address found in the Vagrantfile is 192.168.50.5 So add this
line to the file below all other lines.

example.local 192.168.50.5

Now go back to your original terminal tab. If the process has finished, visit
http://example.local and check it out, a fresh Drupal install.


And voila, you have a site installed!

##Now let's have some fun.

For those who don't know, vampd isn't about just spinning up a site and dumping
a database to share across a team, actually it is quite against that. We aim to
create reproducible environments and code from every aspect. The server should match
what you are going live on, and your site should be able to deploy into production
with a simple install, or if you have a live site, updates should be applied via
update hooks, check out our desire for a standard dev process in the [wiki](http://github.com/vampd/vampd)
